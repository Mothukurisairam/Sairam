#To check a file or directory in a specific directory in python3

# First we need to import os in python3
import os

# Defining directory in to python
directory_name=<directory name under the current directory>

#  Pass the file name in to "for" loop. It helps to redirect all the files in the specific directory
for name in os.listdir(directory_name):

# Join file names and directory name in to one variable
fullname=os.path.join(directory_name,name)

# Taking the if condition. if it is directory it print it is a directory. or else it print it is  file.
